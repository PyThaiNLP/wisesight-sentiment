## Data characteristics and preprocessing

*This corpus does not claim to be a statistically representative sample of the
Thai language register.*

General information:

- **Size:** 26,737 messages.
- **Language:** Central Thai.
- **Style:**
  Informal and conversational, with some news headlines and advertisements.

Data coverage:

- **Time period:**
  Approximately 2016 to early 2019, with a small amount from other periods.
- **Domains:**
  Mixed, with a majority focusing on consumer products and services
  (restaurants, cosmetics, drinks, cars, hotels).
  Some current affairs topics are also included.

Privacy:

- Messages were collected from publicly available online sources only
  (websites, blogs, social network sites).
- For Facebook data, this includes public comments on public pages.
- The dataset does not contain private/protected messages or messages from
  groups, chats, and inboxes.
- Personally identifiable information has been removed or masked.

Data alterations and modifications:

- A large portion of messages are not in their original form:
  - Usernames and non-public figure names are removed.
  - Phone numbers are masked (e.g., 088-888-8888, 09-9999-9999, 0-2222-2222).
  - Duplicated, leading, and trailing whitespaces are removed.
  - Other punctuations, symbols, and emojis are retained.
  - Misspellings remain uncorrected.
- Messages exceeding 2,000 characters or non-Thai messages are removed.
- Duplicate messages (exact matches) are removed.

Further exploration:

- Refer to [sbom.spdx3.json](./sbom.spdx3.json) for a machine-readable data
  bill of materials (BOM) in [SPDX 3.0](https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/)
  format.

## Annotation methodology

- Sentiment values are assigned by human annotators.
- A human annotator put his/her best effort to assign just one label,
  out of four, to a message.
- A message can be ambiguous. When possible, the judgement will be based solely
  on the text itself.
  - In some situation, like when the context is missing, the annotator may have
    to rely on his/her own world knowledge and just guess.
  - In some cases, the human annotator may have access to the message's
    context, like an image.
    These additional information are not included as part of this corpus.
- Agreement, enjoyment, and satisfaction are positive. Disagreement, sadness,
  and disappointment are negative.
- Showing interest in a topic or in a product is counted as positive.
  - In this sense, a question about a particular product could have a positive
    sentiment value, if it shows the interest in the product.
- Saying that other product or service is better is counted as negative.
- General information or news title tend to be counted as neutral.
- For word tokenization annotation methodology, please refer to
  [word-tokenization/README.md](./word-tokenization/README.md).
