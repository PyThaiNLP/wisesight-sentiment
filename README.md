## Sentiment value annotation methodology

- Sentiment values are assigned by human annotators.
- A human annotator put his/her best effort to assign just one label, out of three, to a message.
- A message can be ambiguous. When possible, the judgement will be based solely on the text itself.
  - In some situation, like when the context is missing, the annotator may have to rely on his/her own world knowledge and just guess.
  - In some cases, the human annotator may have an access to the message's context, like an image. These additional information are not included as part of this corpus.
- Agreement, enjoyment, and satisfaction are positive. Disagreement, sadness, and disappointment are negative.
- Showing interest in a topic or in a product is counted as positive.
  - In this sense, a question about a particular product could has a positive sentiment value, if it shows the interest in the product.
- Saying that other product or service is better is counted as negative.
- General information or news title tend to be counted as neutral.


## Copyright and Disclaimer

This annotation is for research purpose and does not reflect the professional work that Wisesight has been done for its customers.
- The human annotator does not necessarily agree or disagree with the message. Likewise, the label he/she made to the message does not necessarily reflect his/her personal view towards the message.
